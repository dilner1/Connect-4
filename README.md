## Design Stage: 

This gave me inspiration on creaitng the game, although with parts that are probably too complex for me.

What MUST be include:
- Changes between player one and player two after each go
- Player go indicator
- Chips must stack ontop of each other
- Placing 4 of the same colour chips in a row, colum or diagnally provides a win
- detect which player won

The classic game of connect 4 is 7 counters wide and 6 counters high.

Non-essential elements to add
- start menu
- AI player option
- timer

having a coloured button to show who's go it is - it look good and combined with text would be good for visually impared users.
